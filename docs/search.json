These nationwide geospatial data products reflect current and historic conditions and include ecosystem dynamic models that can be used for conservation, fire planning, and land management decisions."

Led by TNC Ecologist, Randy Swaty, the CDL meets weekly to collaborate, problem solve, try out (and break) code, create cool maps and produce insightful data visualizations (among other things).\nCheck out the CDL’s 2022 Accomplishments here.\nCDL members donated their time to complete this web app for the SRFSN. Projects like these provide real-life opportunities to apply new techniques to answer common natural resource questions. A big thanks to Myles Walimaa for GIS processing R code.\nThe CDL is dedicated to fostering curious, independently minded, problem solving scientists. Learn more about the CDL here."
